# Minimal-Split-Completions-Heggernes-Mancini
An implementation of the algorithms about Minimal Split Completion proposed by Heggernes and Mancini [1].

The algorithms was implemented in Java.

In the mainclass you can choose to run one of the three algorithms:
 SplitGraphSequence
 ExtractMinimal
 MinimalSplit
